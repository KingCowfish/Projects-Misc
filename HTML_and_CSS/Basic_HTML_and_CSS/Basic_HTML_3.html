	<div>
		<p><i>When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,</P>
		<p><i>I all alone beweep my outcast state,</P>
		<p><i>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</P>
		<p><i>And look upon myself and curse my fate,</P>
		<p><i>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</P>
		<p><i>Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,</P>
		<p><i>Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,</P>
		<p><i>With what I most enjoy contented least;</P>
		<p><i>Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,</P>
		<p><i>Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</P>
		<p><i>(Like to the lark at break of day arising</P>
		<p><i>From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;</P>
		<p><i>	  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings</P>
		<p><i>	  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</P></i>
