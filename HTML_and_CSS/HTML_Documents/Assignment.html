			<h1>Corgis</h1>
			<p>Here is a short description about Corgis from the American Kennel Club Website:</p>
			
			<blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi/">
			At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male 
			Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, 
			muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day’s work. Built 
			long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, 
			sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.

			The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human 
			family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they 
			are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses 
			and a “big dog” bark. Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke’s 
			need for activity and togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet.
